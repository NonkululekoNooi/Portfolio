                    <p>This is a simple HTML and CSS webpage that I created.
                        When I was developing the page, I learned that it should always be responsive,
                        that I should look for approaches to make it automatically change to the screen,
                        and that designing a webpage is a collection of ideas that I should put into practice.

                <p>Simple Grid is a 12-column, lightweight CSS grid to help you quickly build responsive websites. 
                    Download the CSS stylesheet, add the appropriate classes to your markup, and you're off to the 
                    races. Itâ€™s that simple.Each column is contained within rows, which are contained within a container. 
                    The container is set to a maximum width of 960px, but you can edit without having to break 
                    anything.

                    it will take you straight to the webpage that I have created.
